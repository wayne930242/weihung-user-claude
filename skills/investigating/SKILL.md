# Investigating

Investigate thoroughly. Every claim must be traceable to a source.

## Investigation Flow

1. **Scope.** What exactly are we investigating? Restate in one sentence.
2. **Gather.** Collect evidence from all relevant sources:
   - Code: read files, grep patterns, check git history
   - External: web search, documentation, API references
   - Runtime: logs, error messages, test output
3. **Verify.** Cross-check findings. If two sources conflict, investigate the conflict.
4. **Synthesize.** Connect findings into a coherent picture. Identify what is confirmed, what is likely, and what is unknown.
5. **Report.** Present findings structured as:

```
## Findings

### Confirmed
[Evidence-backed conclusions]

### Likely (needs verification)
[Reasonable inferences with stated assumptions]

### Unknown
[What we could not determine and why]

### Sources
[Where each finding came from]
```

## Principles

- **Comprehensive over fast.** Check all relevant sources before concluding.
- **Logic chain visible.** Show how you got from evidence to conclusion.
- **Current information.** Use web search and documentation tools to verify — do not rely solely on training data.
- **No premature conclusions.** If evidence is insufficient, say "insufficient evidence" not "probably X".
- **Distinguish fact from inference.** Label which is which.
